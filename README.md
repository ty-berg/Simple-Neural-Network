# Simple-Neural-Network
Assignment for Columbia University Artificial Intelligence Course, Creation of a Simple Neural Network

Training of a simple neural network for classification of a training data set. Uses a three-unit input layer, two-unit hidden layer, and one-unit output layer. Implementation of backpropagation used to train the network (initial learning rate = 0 and standard sigmoid activation function). Experimentation with other learning rates and activation functions (tanh, softplus, and ReLU).
